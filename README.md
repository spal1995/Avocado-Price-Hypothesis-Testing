We started by exploring the average prices of avocados, focusing on both conventional and organic types. Our initial context was to see if Millennials could potentially afford more avocados and achieve their "American Dream" by finding cities with cheaper avocados. The hypothesis tests performed include Z-tests, T-tests, and variance tests.

Key Hypotheses and Findings:
One-Sample Z-Test on Proportion:

Null Hypothesis (H0): The proportion of conventional avocados with prices above $1.50 is less than or equal to 0.35.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The proportion of conventional avocados with prices above $1.50 is greater than 0.35.
Result: We did not reject the null hypothesis, indicating that the proportion of high-priced conventional avocados did not significantly exceed 0.35.
One-Sample T-Test on Mean Price:

Null Hypothesis (H0): The average price of an avocado is equal to $1.50.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The average price of an avocado is not equal to $1.50.
Result: We rejected the null hypothesis, showing that the average price significantly differed from $1.50.
Two-Sample T-Test on Regional Prices:

Null Hypothesis (H0): The average price of avocados in HartfordSpringfield is equal to that in Houston.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The average price in HartfordSpringfield is different from that in Houston.
Result: We found a significant difference, indicating that the price variation between these regions was noteworthy.
Variance Test:

Null Hypothesis (H0): The variance in avocado prices in 2017 is less than or equal to 0.1^2.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The variance in avocado prices in 2017 is greater than 0.1^2.
Result: We rejected the null hypothesis, suggesting that the price variance in 2017 was significantly high, affirming the "Avocadopocalypse."
These analyses provided valuable insights into avocado price trends, regional price differences, and price volatility.
